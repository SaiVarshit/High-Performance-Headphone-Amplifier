# INTRODUCTION

ThIS  is a high-performance headphone amplifier designed to deliver superior audio quality using the NE5532 operational amplifier and a powerful Class AB output stage. This project aims to create an affordable and efficient headphone amplifier powered by a single 20V DC power supply. The design incorporates key features such as linear voltage regulation, a hybrid op-amp and discrete output stage, and a high gain of 20dB to effectively drive low impedance headphones. This report details the design requirements, circuit topology, LTspice Simulations,
PCB design of the circuit diagram.
